# Graphics_RayTracer

A small project following the open source text: "Raytracing In a Weekend" by Peter Shirley.
The purpose of this project is to understand the concepts behind ray-tracing so that this process may potentially later be adapted to realtime, GPU based rendering and use in animations, game developement, or high-quality image fabrication.

The process undergone for this learning started with copying most of the code from the text itself, working out the bugs, and proceeded to be revised and restructured as needed for my own understanding, the increasing of efficiency, or refactoring to meet modern coding standards.
